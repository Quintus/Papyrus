= Papyrus--a PDF Generator for RDoc (based on LaTeX)

This library is a plugin for Ruby’s documentation generator
RDoc[http://github.com/rdoc/rdoc]. It provides both a generator for
outputting PDF (Portable document format) (the
RDoc::Generator::Papyrus class) files and a formatter for
turning the parsed RDoc markup into LaTeX code
(RDoc::Markup::ToLaTeX; RDoc::Markup::ToLaTeX_Crossref adds
cross-reference facilities).

== Requirements

* This is written in Ruby[http://ruby-lang.org], so you’ll obviously need Ruby.
  Version 1.9.2 or greater required.
* RDoc[http://github.com/rdoc/rdoc], the Ruby documentation tool, version 3.9 or greater.
* The generator uses LaTeX[http://latex-project.org] to generate the PDF files
  (pdfLaTeX, to be exact), so you’ll need this as well. LaTeX2e required.

== Installation

Papyrus is available via RubyGems[http://rubygems.org].
Install it via:

  # gem install papyrus

If you prefer to be on the bleeding edge, clone the sourcecode
repository and build the gem yourself:

  $ git clone http://git.pegasus-alpha.eu/papyrus.git
  $ rake gem
  # gem install --local --pre pkg/papyrus-x.y.z

== Usage

To use it from the commandline, pass RDoc the <tt>-f</tt>
commandline switch specifying "papyrus":

  $ rdoc -f papyrus

You may also set this permantently in your +RDOCOPT+ environment
variable (although I don’t recommand this--all the gems you 
install will get PDF documentation then).

The other way is to use the library from within a Ruby
program. Require it via:

  gem "rdoc" #Won’t work with any RDoc < 3.9
  require "rdoc/generator/papyrus"

and then do

  opts = RDoc::Options.new
  # Specify your options...
  opts.generator = RDoc::Generator::Papyrus
  RDoc::RDoc.new.document(opts)

In both cases you’ll find a file <tt>Documentation.pdf</tt>
in your documentation output directory (usually <tt>doc/</tt>).

=== Extra commandline options

The PDF generator adds some commandline options to RDoc, namely:

[<tt>--show-pages</tt>]
  Allows you to suppress the page numbers automatically added
  to each cross reference. If you know you won’t print your
  documentation and your PDF viewer supports cross-references,
  you may turn them off via <tt>--no-show-pages</tt>. Defaults
  to true.
[<tt>--latex-command</tt>]
  If your pdfLaTeX’s executable for whatever reason isn’t named
  +pdflatex+ (the default), you can set the name here.
[<tt>--babel-lang</tt>]
  If you write your documentation in a language other than English,
  this option may be interesting for you. It specified the option(s)
  passed to the +babel+ package loaded in the main generated LaTeX
  file and as such allows things like changing hyphenation patterns.
  Note however, that hard-coded strings like "Public class methods"
  aren’t changed by this yet (*may* come with a later release).

== Web pages

* The project is hosted here: http://redmine.pegasus-alpha.eu/projects/papyrus
* Report bugs at: http://redmine.pegasus-alpha.eu/projects/papyrus/issues

== Known Problems

* No cross-referencing inside headings and the labels of labeled lists.
  This is a technical restriction as the complex references this
  template creates confuse LaTeX when used in that places.

== Author

This software was written by Marvin Gülker for the German company
of {Pegasus Alpha}[http://pegasus-alpha.eu], which disclaims all
interest on Papyrus. You can contact me at

== Thanks

Many thanks for the valuable help of Eric Hodel of RDoc fame. He
gave me all the pieces of advice I needed when I was stuck at
some obscure point of generation or formatting and even changed
RDoc’s API to allow implementing non-HTML cross-references. Without 
him, this plugin wouldn’t have made it into a releasable state.

=== A note on the license

As soon as Ruby 1.9.3 final is out, this will be licensed under GPLv3.
Just in case you wonder why it isn’t that yet, Ruby’s license is at the
moment not compatible with the GPLv3, but with the upcomming 1.9.3 release, 
Ruby switches to a BSD-style license which allows this.
